<h1>The Best Movies List</h1>
<h2>Best Movies I Know</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Happy Gilmore</h3>
<p>Why won't Joe finish this with me? I want to see Bob Barker destroy Happy.</p>
<h3>John Wick 4</h3>
<p>The action was good throughout put really I think the plot is pointless.</p>
<h3>Wish</h3>
<p>Watched this with the boys. There are a few good songs, but the villian felt pointlessly villianous. Also not a fan of the goat.</p>
